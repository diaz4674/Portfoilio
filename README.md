## Welcome

This repo/site is used for the purpose of showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information. Much of this site required additional
learning such as the Adobe Suite, and the animation/keyframe features with CSS. It was fun to build, and there seems to always be something to
optimize or enhance.

## Tech Stack
+ [React](https://reactjs.org/) was the UI utilized for this project.

### Libraries:
+ [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts) was utilized for the carousel, and top navigation bar. I had to customize it with additional CSS to make it look a specific way.
+ [React-Scrollable-Anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrollable-anchor) helped with the navigation scroll when the user requests a specifc section.
+ [React-Animate-On-Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animate-on-scroll) assisted in giving an animated transition to load the component to the user.
